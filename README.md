# iidx-ps2tools

My code from working on PS2 IIDX games.
This is an attempt to extract data directly from the archives, without guessing/bruteforcing.

The goal of these tools is to convert directly from PS2 IIDX to AC IIDX without losing information as much as possible. Charts are supported as far as converting them to JSON or another IIDX chart format. I currently do not plan on adding support for BMS files, but if someone wants to create a reader/writer plugin, then it should (in theory) be possible to convert any chart format with a reader to BMS and BMS to any chart format with a writer.

Overlays are supported (code is currently not in repo) for all games, but only one half of the code is finished. The code currently only supports saving to GIF format but I would like to convert them directly to the formats used by AC IIDX (afp stuff). Overlay code will be uploaded whenever I feel it's ready. My goal is to extract the overlays primarily, but the UI for post-9th style games also uses the same animation engine so those will work to some extent as well.

This is all WIP still so no instructions will be posted until it's ready for some kind of public release.
